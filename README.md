# Image_Classification

(1) Image Classification 1

    Multi-label Image Classification with ResNet

    Dataset used: Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset

    Feature Visualization Techniques:
    (1) Principal component analysis (PCA)
    (2) t-SNE
    (3) Guided backpropagation
    (4) Grad-CAM
    
(2) Image Classification 2

    Digit Classification with CNN
    
    Dataset used: The SVHN Database of handwritten digits
    http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/
    
    SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition 
    algorithms with minimal requirement on data preprocessing and formatting. It can be seen as 
    similar in flavor to MNIST (e.g., the images are of small cropped digits), but incorporates an order 
    of magnitude more labeled data (over 600,000 digit images) and comes from a significantly harder, 
    unsolved, real world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is 
    obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images
